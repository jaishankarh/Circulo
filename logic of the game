any new ideas or logic can be part of this text... it is like some rough pad where ideas just jump in and i note down... nothin needs to be conccrete or fixed in this text..

events based on a timeline tthat is defined by the timer event handler

the timer event handler keeps calling the main loop function of the game which calls, checks and does everything necessary

The main function of the game contains:
  draw the balls
  check for colllisions
    check if user ball has collided with pink ball.....game ends then
  generate new balls
  update the state of all objects
  


on a seperate side the user event handling will take place.. so when ever the user presses a key:
  the user ball moves
  check for collisions
  generate new balls
  update the state of all objects
  
The different functions i can think of..:
  collision detector
  perform collisions
  draw ball objects
  ball generator
    white
    pink
  
  
  
  collision detector:
    if the user ball collides with any other pink ball then game ends...
    to detect collision we can check:
      if( the ball1 center is at least a diameter away from ball2 )
	then we can say that the balls are not colliding
      else we say that the balls have already collided or are colliding..
      
      the detector has to check collisions considering every pair of ball objects..as the number of ball objects grow the permutations can increase....
      
  
    
  
  perform collisions:
    maintain momentum..
    calculate new velocities..
    
    
  generate new balls:
    initialize them with a velocity downward...randomize the downward angle (but randomize within a range)
    
    
  ball object:
    contains:
      a speed vector (which contains an  x component and a y component)
      type attribute
      current location (defined by x, y coordinates)
